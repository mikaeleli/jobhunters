To run this program you will need to install the dependencies first, be it in a virtual env, container or
on a system level

You can install them by running the following in your environment of choice

"""
  pip install -r requirements.txt
"""

Next you will need to run django migrations to set up the database with the following command

"""
  python manage.py migrate
"""

By default it will create an sqlite database in the app directory, this can be overridden by setting up your own
database connection in settings.py and then re-running the migration.

NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR: In the version we sent to you our cloud database credentials are already active in settings.py.

The migration imports a lot of data for demonstration purposes. In this process it creates users that you might want to
login as while testing the system.

We provide a command to conveniently set the password for all users, strictly for testing of course.

python manage.py change_all_passwords PASSWORD  // Where PASSWORD is a string that you want to put as all users password
